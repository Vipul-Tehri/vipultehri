            The essence of the ballet flat has existed since at least the 16th century, when men wore a similar shoe,
            then known as pompes. In medieval times ballet flats were popular with both men and women. They only went
            out of fashion in the 17th and 18th centuries when the high-heeled shoe came into fashion after Catherine
            de' Medici requested that her cobbler add 5 cm (2 inches) to her wedding shoes. Heels went out of fashion
            quickly after Marie Antoinette walked to the guillotine in a pair of heels. Functional shoes – sandals,
            boots, and flat shoes – prevailed in the 19th century. Ballet flats took off again when Audrey Hepburn wore
            them with cigarette pants in Funny Face in 1957.

            In 1947, Rose Repetto hand stitched her first ballet flat for her son, famous dancer and choreographer,
            Roland Petit. Once actress Brigette Bardot donned a pair of Repetto's flats, variations of ballet flats
            became wildly popular and returned as a fashion trend.[1] They are also often referred to as ballet pumps or
            ballet sneakers and designed for outdoor wear, using a variety of fabrics and usually with a rubber sole.
